# water_oil_interface
Example analysis scripts for paper examining water-oil interface with Raman spectroscopy. Scripts are contained within Jupyter notebooks in the directories given below.

./Raman_analysis contains scripts used in analying the computational Raman of the interface.

./amoeba_analysis contains scripts used in analying the structure of the interface in simulations run with the AMOEBA model.

./amoeba_analysis/example_Raman_calculation contains a signac workspace used for computing Raman frequencies from electric fields. It also contains all scripts used for computing the Raman spectra.
